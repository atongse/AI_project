Pokémon[a][b] is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The franchise's primary target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[2] but it is known to attract people of all ages.[I] Pokémon is estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and is one of the best-selling video game franchises.

The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on 27 February 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular culture, with new products releasing to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic.

Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company,[12] Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[1] Game Freak develops the core series RPGs, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside Asia.[13][14]

Name
The original full name of the franchise is Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā), which has been commonly abbreviated to Pokemon (ポケモン) since its launch. When the franchise was released internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) over the e to aid in pronunciation.[15]

Pokémon refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe. As a noun, it is identical in both the singular and plural, as is every individual species name.[16] Thus, it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".[17]

General concept
See also: Pokémon (video game series) § Gameplay
The Pokémon franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon. The original pair of games feature 151 Pokémon species, with new ones being added in subsequent games; as of January 2024, 1,025 Pokémon species have been introduced.[c] Most Pokémon are based on real-life animals or mythical creatures from folklore.[18] For example, Pikachu are a yellow, mouse-like species with tails shaped as lightning bolts, able to blast powerful electric jolts through the air.[19][20][21]


Poké Balls are used to capture Pokémon.
The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer has three primary goals: travel and explore the Pokémon world; discover and catch a specimen of each Pokémon species in order to complete their Pokédex; and train a team of Pokémon and have them engage in battles.[22][23][24] Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device. If the catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and under the Trainer's command from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state.[25][26] The Trainer's Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by other Trainers.[27] Because the franchise is aimed at children, these battles are never presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore.[II] Pokémon never die in battle – they faint upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at a Pokémon Center.[III]

History
Origins
The main idea behind Pokémon was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri was born on 28 August 1965,[36] and grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo.[37] As a child, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town.[38][39] During Japan's economic miracle, many cities, including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a consequence, Machida's nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of junior high school,[40][41] an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, introducing him to video games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo College of Technology [ja], Tajiri began publishing a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak. The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time.[42] He self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17.[43][44] At the time, magazines specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill a gap in the market.[45][46] Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.[47] Game Freak folded in the late 1980s,[43] by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game industry.[48] Through his work, Tajiri befriended Tsunekazu Ishihara, a Japanese business man who, among other things, produced game-related shows for Fuji Television.[49][50][51]

In 1986, Tajiri, Sugimori, and a few other enthusiasts started an informal development team called Game Freak, named after the magazine it grew out of. Over the next few years, they independently developed the puzzle game Quinty, working on it alongside school or their regular jobs.[52] However, no one within the group knew how to make the game's music. After consulting all his contacts, Tajiri got in touch with Junichi Masuda, who became the group's composer.[53] Quinty was finished in 1989, and published by Namco.[54] Tajiri officially incorporated Game Freak Co., Ltd. on 26 April 1989.[55]

1989–1995: Development of Red and Green
Further information: Pokémon Red and Blue § Development

Two original Game Boys connected with a Game Link Cable
Tajiri started to think of what was to become Pokémon while completing Quinty, and before he officially founded Game Freak. Around this time, Nintendo announced the upcoming release of the Game Boy, a handheld console that would revolutionize the gaming industry. Tajiri learned that the device would have a link port, and with the corresponding Game Link Cable, two Game Boys could be linked together.[56] Sometime later, Tajiri remembered an incident while playing Dragon Quest II (1987), a role-playing game (RPG) for the Famicom (NES). The game features randomly appearing items of varying rarity, including an extremely rare item called Mysterious Hat.[d] Tajiri did not encounter any, while Ken Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered two. Upon recalling this experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible to transfer things from one cartridge to another.[IV] He noted that, until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not for something else.[61] Combining this inspiration with his memories of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri's idea would eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood experiences,[62] and an attempt to "regain the world that he had lost".[63] He would later state that the game represents "the story of a boy's summer day".[64]


Gashapon capsules have been cited as an inspiration for Pokemon.
Tajiri and his Game Freak staff began pondering over a game centered on capturing creatures of differing rarity. Since the Game Boy is a portable device, these creatures could then be exchanged with other players in real life using the link cable. Once the player has caught a creature in-game, it was to be stored in miniaturized form in a special capsule. This facet of the game was inspired by Ultraseven, a tokusatsu show that Tajiri had enjoyed as a child.[65] The series' titular character owns a number of capsules containing miniaturized kaiju (monsters), which come out and return to their original sizes when the capsule is thrown into mid-air. Kaiju media in general were an important influence on Pokemon, as many Game Freak staff members had grown up with them.[58][66] Other influences that have been cited by Tajiri include: gashapon, capsules with toy figures in them that can be drawn from vending machines;[67][68] collectible cards, such as baseball cards, Ultraman cards and menko;[V] The Final Fantasy Legend (1989), the first RPG for the Game Boy;[73] and petting in Japan, with Tajiri noting that having Pokemon is similar to having pets.[74] Tajiri initially named his project Capsule Monsters, which GF's staff commonly shortened to Capumon. However, it later turned out that the term Capsule Monsters could not be trademarked, and it was subsequently decided to call the game Pocket Monsters, which became Pokemon.[75][76]

In March 1989, Nintendo and Shigesato Itoi co-founded Ape Inc., a company meant to give outside talent a chance to pitch new, innovative games.[50][51] At the time, Ape was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.[77] Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and Tajiri, was involved with Ape's management (and would become its vice-president in 1991).[78][50] Tajiri's relationship with Ishihara prompted Tajiri to present his idea for Pocket Monsters at Ape's office.[79][80] Present during Tajiri's pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at Nintendo's General Affairs Department and was also a manager at Ape.[51][81] Kawaguchi brought the idea to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, who reportedly said: "This is it. This is the idea I've been waiting for."[82] The development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a planned delivery of the game in October.[83] Tajiri directed the project, working under Ishihara.[84] Ishihara was the producer – he managed the budget, staff, and work schedule, monitored the game's overall progress, and served as a liaison between Game Freak and Nintendo.[85][86] Ishihara also contributed ideas to the development,[87] and helped with debugging.[88][89] Sugimori was in charge of the graphics and character design.[90] Masuda created all music and sound effects, and did part of the programming.[91] The budget that Nintendo granted to Game Freak was low;[83] thus, Pocket Monsters was initially planned as a small, compact game, based primarily around Tajiri's core idea of exchanging.[73][92] However, as development progressed, GF's ideas and ambitions for Pokemon grew.[73] They soon realized that the game they were beginning to envision would not be easy to make.[93] Pocket Monsters was suspended indefinitely, and GF turned their focus on other titles (see Game Freak § Games).

After the game's initial development phase in 1990 and 1991,[94] the staff "tinkered with it from time to time", as Sugimori put it.[95] Still, development had mostly come to a halt until the summer of 1994, after the release of Pulseman, upon which Tajiri decided it was time to make a serious effort towards finishing Pocket Monsters.[96] By this point, Game Freak's experience had grown considerably. Over the years, a number of new staff members had been added to the company. One of them was Atsuko Nishida, a graphic artist who created Pikachu, among others.[97][98][99] Ishihara used his knowledge of card games to add more depth to the battle system, and among other things suggested Pokemon types. Ishihara also came up with the idea of the Pokedex, a portable encyclopedic device which players can use to keep track of the Pokemon they caught.[87] On the suggestion of Shigeru Miyamoto, it was decided to release two editions of the game: a Red version and a Green version. Otherwise identical, each had Pokemon not found in the other, encouraging players to socialize and trade to complete their collection.[100][101]

Ishihara aspired to create video games of his own.[102] As Pocket Monsters Red and Green were nearing completion, Ishihara founded Creatures, Inc. on 8 November 1995. Upon founding, the company was housed in the same office building as Nintendo in Tokyo.[103] Co-ownership of the Pokemon property, which Ishihara helped create, was subsequently assigned to Creatures. This resulted in Pokemon having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures, representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne Allison wrote that Nintendo also bought the property after Red and Green were finished.[104] Kenji Hatakeyama noted that the ownership structure of Pokemon is uncommon.[12] He wrote that "Pokemon is probably the only property in the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a single company", like The Walt Disney Company does with their IPs.[105] Tajiri and Ishihara did consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point. However, Tajiri decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had built up since he was a teenager. "I felt threatened by the idea of changing how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara", he said. "It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would I". Tajiri noted that, since Game Freak and Creatures both focus on Pokemon, it sometimes felt more like different departments than different companies.[79]

1996–1998: Rise in Japan
CoroCoro manga, Mew lottery
After finally being finished in December 1995,[106] Pocket Monsters Red and Green were released on 27 February 1996. Nintendo had no high expectations of the games, and media largely ignored them.[107] By 1996, the seven-year-old Game Boy console was considered yesterday's news and near the end of its lifecycle.[32][108][109] On the other hand, new Game Boys continued to be manufactured and sold.[110] The console was widespread and, due to its age, affordable to children.[32][111]

Two media channels that would play important roles in the Pokemon franchise were the CoroCoro Comic, released monthly, and its sister magazine Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic, released bi-monthly. Both manga magazines are published by Shogakukan, a long-time business partner of Nintendo, and have featured manga based on Nintendo properties (e.g. Super Mario-kun, Kirby of the Stars, Donkey Kong). At the time of Pokemon's release, the main CoroCoro magazine was read by one in four elementary school students.[112] CoroCoro's deputy editor-in-chief was Masakazu Kubo [ja]. On Ishihara's suggestion,[113] Kubo commissioned the creation of a manga adaptation, written and illustrated by Kosaku Anakubo [ja].[114] Shogakukan, which frequently surveys their target groups, determined that the Pocket Monsters manga was well received.[115]

To further promote Red and Green, the May issue of CoroCoro, released on 15 April 1996, announced the "Legendary Pokemon Offer", centered around a mysterious, secret Pokemon called Mew.[116][117] Mew was a last-minute addition to Red & Green. It is unobtainable in the game(s) through usual means, and was intended to be used at a later point in some post-launch activity.[118] To participate in the promotion, CoroCoro readers had to send in a postcard, and from the entrants, 20 were selected at random. The winners then had to send in their cartridge so that Mew could be uploaded onto it. The lottery was a success and increased word-of-mouth.[32][118] By September, sales of Red and Green had surpassed 1 million units.[119]

Trading Card Game
The Pokemon Trading Card Game was one of the first collectible card games (CCGs) developed in Japan. Its creation was influenced by Magic: The Gathering, the first CCG in history.[120][121][122] Indeed, the Pokemon Trading Card Game can be considered a simplified version of Magic.[123][124] First released in the United States in 1993, Magic had gained popularity not just in North America and Europe, but also in Asia.[125] Ishihara was fond of playing cards,[87] and had contributed to the development of at least three simple card games designed by Shigesato Itoi and released through Ape, Inc.[e] At the time, Ishihara was particularly interested in Magic: The Gathering.[120] While developing the Pokemon RPG, he realized that the concept behind it could be adapted into a Magic-like CCG.[51] The Pokemon Trading Card Game was designed by Ishihara,[132] Akihiko Miura, Kōichi Ōyama, and Takumi Akabane.[133] All were former staff members of Ape and had previously worked on EarthBound (1994): Miura was the game's main designer, Ōyama was its art director, and Akabane was one of its chief debuggers.[134]

While card games have a long history in Japan, a collectible card game was a relatively new concept there, and at the time not widely known.[135] Because of this, Ishihara had difficulties finding distributors. Sometime in 1995, Ishihara pitched the card game to Nintendo. They agreed to have the cards manufactured, subcontracting an unidentified printing company. However, Nintendo did not want the hassle of having to develop a distribution system from the ground up, i.e. finding retailers willing to sell a CCG.[136] Ishihara was then contacted by Satoshi Kayama, director of a small firm called Media Factory. Like Ishihara, Kayama was a fan of card games. He felt that CCGs would soon rise to prominence in Japan, and had been gathering information on the possibility of developing such a game in some form. When Kayama heard that Creatures had developed a CCG, he contacted Ishihara and offered to distribute it, signing the contract near the end of 1995.[137] The first Pokemon card set was released on 20 October 1996. Despite being ignored by the media, except for CoroCoro,[138] the cards became an instant success upon release.[139]

Anime production and premiere
By August 1996, Kubo had become convinced of Pokemon's potential, and believed Shogakukan should create an anime adaptation.[140] Nintendo felt reluctant, believing that the property had developed enough as it had over the course of six months. At that time, they did not consider such a significant expansion to be necessary.[141] Nintendo also noted that if the anime would flop, it would negatively affect future Pokemon games.[142] Ishihara initially opposed the idea, because he thought it would overly hasten the 'consumption' of the property: he feared that if the series would end, people would assume that Pokemon has ended, and move on to the next thing.[143] At the time, Creatures and Game Freak were planning the sequel(s) to Red and Green, Pokemon Gold and Silver, and Ishihara did not want the anime to end before they could release their new games.[144][145] Kubo was ultimately able to resolve the concerns of all parties involved. An important aspect of Kubo's bargaining power was the then-ongoing Mini 4WD craze and its accompanying hit series Bakusō Kyōdai Let's & Go!!. Kubo had an important role in the creation of both, which impressed the stakeholders.[146] To appease Ishihara, Kubo promised him that the anime would last for at least a year and a half. This was unusually long for a debuting anime, and required a big investment.[144][147] Kubo's proposal for Pocket Monsters was officially approved on 26 September 1996.[148] For Nintendo of Japan, it was the first time they licensed a TV series.[149] Kubo assigned independent producer Choji Yoshikawa [ja] to lead the project.[150]

Shogakukan Productions, commonly called ShoPro, was Shogakukan's production company. The animation company they commissioned was OLM, Inc. (Oriental Light and Magic), on Kubo's suggestion.[151] Kunihiko Yuyama, one of OLM's founding members, became the anime's director. ShoPro assembled a team of five writers, plus two supporting writers.[152] All key people involved with the production of Pokemon were well-experienced and had proven track records within Japan's anime industry. Yoshikawa felt that the team got lucky. "The probability of so many great people coming together at the same time is very low", he said.[153] Per Tajiri's explicit condition,[154] every anime team member had to play the game extensively, including the illustrators and voice actors.[153] The anime staff "unanimously agreed that the game was interesting"[155] and "felt connected with each other through the world of Pokemon",[153] feeling positively challenged to make an anime that would match the game's quality.[156]

A production council was formed to produce the anime. Different people appeared at different meetings, but four individuals usually present were Ishihara of Creatures, Sugimori of Game Freak, Yuyama of OLM, and independent producer Yoshikawa. Yoshikawa had the final say. The council decided on the anime's worldview, characters, general storyline, and various important details. The early meetings, which were also attended by Tajiri, usually started with a Q&A session in which Tajiri and Ishihara were asked about the Pokemon universe.[157] The council was careful to have the anime be in concordance with the video game. Inevitably, there had to be differences between the two, but all agreed that the overall worldview as envisioned by Tajiri should not be disturbed.[158] At the start of the video game, the player has to choose one of three starter Pokemon: Fushigidane, Hitokage, or Zenigame (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle). The council didn't want to unfairly popularize any of them, and wanted the protagonist to start out with a different Pokemon.[159][160] They unanimously decided that a Pikachu should be one of Pokemon's central icons.[161] They expected Pikachu to appeal to both boys and girls, as well as their mothers. This would expand the franchise's audience, which was considered a core objective of the anime.[162][163]

During the council's first meeting, Yoshikawa brought up the issue on whether the Pokemon in the anime could talk, and if not, how they could communicate. In the video games, each has a specific cry. In Anakubo's CoroCoro manga, most could speak. At first, the council believed there should be a mixture of Pokemon that could talk and some that could not. However, this idea was eventually discarded: the Pokemon had to make a specific cry. The council agreed that Pokemon were like animals, and while they and humans should be able to understand each other in the series, they should not speak each other's language.[164] It was decided that Pikachu would repeatedly say its own name in various intonations. The role of Pikachu was given to Ikue Otani. During try-outs, Yuyama had Otani voice Pikachu in normal Japanese, as well as in 'Pikachu talk', in which it only said the syllables of its name. Yuyama realized that, even in the latter style of limited communication, Otani was experienced enough to still convey the messages and emotions needed.[165]

Pocket Monsters premiered on 1 April 1997. By November, it had become the highest-rated program on TV Tokyo.[166]

"Dennō Senshi Porygon" incident
See also: Pokémon episodes removed from rotation
In the evening of 16 December 1997, the Pokemon franchise was hit by a crisis related to the broadcast of the anime's 38th episode, "Dennō Senshi Porygon" (Computer Warrior Porygon). It was watched by approximately 4.6 million households.[167] In the episode, the cast is transported into a virtual world, accompanied by a Porygon, an artificially-made Pokemon. While flying through cyberspace, they are attacked by an anti-virus program which mistakes them for viruses, shooting "vaccine missiles" at them resulting in explosions of bright, rapidly swapping red and blue flashes.[168]

The intense stimuli brought about by the episode triggered a variety of adverse health effects in more than 10,000 viewers,[169] primarily irritated eyes, headaches, dizziness, and nausea.[170] A small part suffered a photosensitive epileptic seizure, manifested in loss of conscious and/or convulsions.[170][171] Hundreds[f] of children were brought to hospitals, although some had recovered enough upon arrival and did not need to be hospitalized. No one died. Broadcasting of Pokemon was halted, and new guidelines were implemented to help prevent similar events from happening.[177] With the show on hiatus, ShoPro and OLM worked on a feature Pokemon film. By the time the incident occurred, its script was already written and storyboards were being made. In mid-January, the staff resumed creating new episodes.[178] The anime series returned on 16 April 1998.[179] The film, titled Pocket Monsters the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (Pokémon: The First Movie), premiered on 18 July 1998, becoming the fourth highest grossing film of the year in Japan.[180][181]

Ultimately, the incident did not damage the Pokemon franchise – it in fact grew further during and after the anime's hiatus. While video rental tapes were removed from shelves,[182][183] all other Pokemon products continued to be sold as usual, and customer demand for them remained high.[184][185] Helping matters was a general understanding among businesses that the anime was not canceled, but rather suspended, and many executives (correctly) expected the show to be resumed after precautions had been taken. Supermarkets and other distribution outlets responded calmly to the crisis, and did not remove Pokemon products from their sales floors.[186]

1998–2000: International expansion
North America
"When we started this project in Japan, one of the first things I was told was that this kind of thing would never appeal to American audiences. They said, 'Because the characters are in a very Japanese style, you cannot sell them to Americans'. So from the very beginning, I never thought there would be an English version. Now, it's just as popular in the United States [as in Japan], and I realized that we shouldn't always believe the opinions of conservative marketers."

Shigeru Miyamoto, August 1999[187]
Possibly the first official to show interest in a North American launch of Pokemon was Minoru Arakawa, founder and then-president of Nintendo of America (NoA). Arakawa visited Japan to participate in Shoshinkai 1996, held 22–24 November. It was around this time when he first played one of the three Pokemon titles released at the time. He thought the games were promising, but Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) had no plans at the time to release them elsewhere. He returned to America with a few cartridges and tested the game on his employees – they did not believe it would work in the US.[188] At the time, role-playing games (RPGs) were not very popular outside Japan,[189] and NoA executives believed that American children did not have the attention span for such a complex title.[190] Americans were said to be more interested in sport- and action-oriented games, preferably with realistic graphics.[16][191] Japanese people, by contrast, were alleged to care more about characters and plot.[192] Up to that point, few Japanese properties had been successfully mainstreamed in the US, and if they were, it was alleged to be on account of having been properly Americanized: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was considered a prime example of this.[193] Visually, Pokemon was believed to be too kawaii, or cute. It was assumed that Pokemon could not succeed on cute alone – it must also be cool.[194][195] In an effort to enhance the franchise's coolness, NoA considered a graphical redesign and contracted a few external artists to create some test-designs for the American market.[190][195] The mockups they proposed included 'graffiti style' drawings,[195] 'beefed-up' and more muscular looking Pokemon,[196] and a new Pikachu that looked like "a tiger with huge breasts".[194] Arakawa concluded that it "didn't work",[195] and by that time, the anime had begun its production in Japan, leading NoA to conclude it was too late for a graphical revamp anyway.[190]

Of pivotal importance to Pokemon's global expansion was Alfred R. Kahn, CEO of US-based 4Kids Entertainment, NoA's licensing agent since 1987.[197][198] Convinced of the franchise's potential, Kahn agreed to invest an undisclosed sum in return for both the anime and licensing rights.[189] Pokemon became one of the first Japanese media franchises in which both the localization of the anime and the licensing of merchandise was handled by a single company, as well as a non-Japanese company.[199] Kahn suggested to use the short version of the name, "Pokémon", adding an acute accent (´) over the e to assist with pronunciation and "give it a little flair".[15] NoJ president Hiroshi Yamauchi officially approved the project in late November,[200] and subsequently announced it at Space World 1997.[201] However, three weeks later, the "Dennō Senshi Porygon" incident happened, which Kubo felt made even more people resistant to the idea of an overseas introduction.[202]

Market research turned back negative: American kids reportedly did not like Pokémon.[203] Arakawa ignored the study and, convinced of the franchise's potential, allocated an enormous budget to Pokémon's launch. The exact amount was not disclosed, but was reportedly equal to or more than $50 million (c. $96.46 million in 2024), approximately the same amount as the launch budget of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. Arakawa admitted that it was "quite a bit of money", but NoA "had been doing well for several years, so we had a lot of money to spare". He opined that if Pokémon would be as successful in the US as it had been in Japan, "an investment of 1 would turn into 100".[204] NoA and 4Kids proceeded to plan "an all-out effort to repeat the phenomenon in the Western world".[32]

The localization of the Pokémon anime was done by 4Kids, and directed by Norman J. Grossfeld. Grossfeld strongly believed that the anime should be Americanized.[205] At NATPE 1998, he asked ShoPro for a "kind of carte blanche, to let me change the show as I think would work for this market", to which ShoPro agreed.[206] However, no national TV station was interested in buying the anime or financing its localization.[15][189] Kahn then decided to self-finance Pokémon's production costs, despite realizing this "could very well bring down 4Kids" if the show would fail.[206] According to Kahn, they "spend a fortune" on the localization.[31] To have it broadcast in syndication, 4Kids offered the show for free to local TV stations across the country, in exchange for a portion of the advertising revenue.[15][189] NoA assisted, persuading dozens of stations to carry the series by offering to buy some of their advertisement space, spending a total of $5 million (c. $9.65 million in 2024).[191][206] Despite all this, most broadcasters were still reluctant to carry Pokémon, with Grossfeld experiencing difficulties getting through their "preconceived notions or their snobbery for Western-produced animation over something from Asia".[206] At the time, anime had not yet found mainstream popularity in the West. Contemporary news reports cited Sailor Moon[VI] as an example of an anime that had failed to catch on with American youth.[g] Still, with NoA's help, 4Kids ultimately succeeded in contracting 112 broadcasters for Pokémon,[212] reaching "about 85 to 90 percent"[213] of television households. However, many broadcasters gave it off-peak time slots, with starting times like 06:00 or 06:30.[15][191] Prior to the late 1990s, this was the case for many anime in the US.[199]

Grossfeld came up with the advertising slogan "Gotta catch 'em all!" as the English equivalent to the Japanese Pokemon GETTO daze~! (ポケモンゲットだぜー！, Get (the) Pokémon!).[214][215] The phrase "miraculously managed to gain approval" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which normally prohibits the use of injunctions in ads directed at children (e.g. "You must buy this!"). While the tagline may sound commanding, the FCC reasoned that the act of catching is at the core of Pokémon's play. Therefore, the phrase was allowed.[216] The series' theme song was written by John Loeffler and John Siegler, and performed by Jason Paige.[217]

The Pokémon anime was first broadcast on 7 September 1998.[218][219] Pokémon Red Version and Blue Version were released three weeks later, on 28 September 1998.[220] To localize the card game, Nintendo contracted Wizards of the Coast, the creator of Magic: The Gathering.[221] The Pokémon Trading Card Game was officially launched nationwide on 9 January 1999, although pre-sold in select stores in December.[222] Coinciding with the North American launch of Pokémon was the release of the Game Boy Color on 23 November 1998.[223]
